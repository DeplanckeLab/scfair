            <h3>CELLxGENE </h3>
            <p>
                <%= link_to 'CELLxGENE', "https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/", target: "_blank" %> is a suite of tools that help scientists to find, download, explore, analyze, annotate, and publish single-cell datasets. It includes several powerful tools with various features to help you engage with single-cell data.

            <h3>Bgee</h3>
            <p>
                <%= link_to 'Bgee', "https://www.bgee.org/", target: "_blank" %>  is a database for retrieval and comparison of gene expression patterns across multiple animal species, produced from multiple data types including bulk RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, Affymetrix, in situ hybridization, and EST data. Bgee is based exclusively on curated wild-type expression data to provide a comparable reference of gene expression. Bgee produces calls of presence/absence of expression, and of differential over-/under-expression, integrated along with information on gene orthology, and homology between organs. This allows comparisons of expression patterns between species.

            <h3>ASAP</h3>
            <p>
                <%= link_to 'ASAP', "https://asap.epfl.ch/", target: "_blank" %>  (Automated Single-cell Analysis Portal) is an innovative collaborative platform designed for the comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data. This user-friendly portal brings together researchers and bioinformaticians, providing a centralized space to delve into single-cell gene expression profiles. ASAP empowers users with the complete single-cell analysis pipeline, running fully online with step-by-step parametrization and interactive visualization of results. Additionally, ASAP features crowd-annotation, fostering collaboration between researchers and tissue experts. It has already been utilized to annotate ~500k cells in the Fly Cell Atlas, promoting better reproducibility, as the entire pipeline run on ASAP is executed within a downloadable Docker container.
