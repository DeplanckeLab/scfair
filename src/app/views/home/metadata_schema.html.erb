            We use the CELLxGENE metadata schema due to its inclusion of necessary metadata, use of controlled vocabularies, and flexibility. The full schema (v.4.0.0) can be found <%= link_to 'in this github repo', "https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/2c53d2b77a9b76c14955484ae5f378515fe5e72f/schema/4.0.0/schema.md"%>.
